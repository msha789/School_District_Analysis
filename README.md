# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the School District Analysis 

Due to evidence of academic dishonesty at Thomas High School, we have been tasked at re-evaluating the district’s school reading and math scores. This was done by replacing the math and reading scores for the nineth graders at Thomas High School with “NaN” (not a number) values to be able to assess the true district averages without influence of values that might have been achieved through academic dishonesty. 

## Results 
* How is the district summary affected?
    - The percentage of passing math score dropped by 1% whereas the average dropped by less than 1%
    - The percentage of passing reading score dropped by 1% but the average score for this was not affected 
    - The overall passing rate decreased by 1% as well

- This took Thomas High School out of the top five schools where it previously held a position, to 8th position overall out of 15 schools.

    * Math and reading scores by grade

# Summary 
There have been changes to the overall school ranking, the scores in the school size categories, the scores in the school spending categories, and grades averages for grade 9 overall. These have collectively gone down due to the removal of the inflated scores for grade 9. Once the academic dishonesty was discovered, removed and accounted for, these lower scores represent more accurate school scores.
